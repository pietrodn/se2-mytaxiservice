    \item[Precedentedness:] reflects the previous experience of the organisation with this type of project. Very low means no previous experience, Extra high means that the organisation is completely familiar with this application domain.

    \item[Development flexibility:] reflects the degree of flexibility in the development process. Very low means a prescribed process is used; Extra high means that the client only sets general goals.

    \item[Risk resolution:] reflects the extent of risk analysis carried out. Very low means little analysis, Extra high means a complete a thorough risk analysis.
