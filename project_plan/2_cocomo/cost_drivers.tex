\section{Cost Drivers}

Cost Drivers are the parameters of the Effort Equation that reflect some characteristics of the developing process and act as multiplicators on the effort needed to build the project. They appear as factors in the Effort Equation~(\autoref{eq:effort}). Cost Drivers are described in detail in the COCOMO Manual~\cite[p.~25]{cocomo-manual}.

The estimated cost drivers for our project, together with the formula to compute the $EAF$ (Effort Adjustment Factor), are shown in~\autoref{tab:cost-drivers}.
