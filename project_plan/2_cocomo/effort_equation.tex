\section{Effort}

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Effort} = A \times EAF \times KSLOC^E
    \label{eq:effort}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $EAF = \prod_i C_i$: product of all cost drivers
    \item $E=0.91 + 0.01 \times \prod_{i}SF_i$: depends on the scale drivers.
    \item $KSLOC$: Kilo-Source Lines of Code, as estimated in~\autoref{chap:function-points}.
    \item $A=2.94$
\end{itemize}

The effort results \textbf{21.8 person-months}.

\section{Duration}

\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Duration} = 3.67 \times (PM)^{0.28 + 0.2 \times (E-0.91)}
    \label{eq:duration}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $PM$ is the effort as calculated in~\autoref{eq:effort}.
    \item $E$ is the exponent depending on the scale drivers (the same one of the effort equation).
\end{itemize}

The duration calculated from the COCOMO equation from~\cite{cocomo-manual} results \textbf{9.5 months}.
This would result in 2.3 developers needed for this project.

Since our group consists of 3 people, a reasonable development time would be:
\[
    \frac{21.8\textrm{ pm}}{3 \textrm{ people}}=7.3\textrm{ months}
\]

In order to be cautious with the task scheduling, we will approximate it to 8 months.
