\section{Effort Equation}

\[
Effort = A \times EAF \times KSLOC^E
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $EAF = \prod_i C_i$: product of all cost drivers
    \item $E=0.91 + 0.01 \times \prod_{i}SF_i$: depends on the scale drivers.
    \item $KSLOC$: Kilo-Source Lines of Code, as estimated in~\ref{chap:function-points}.
    \item $A=2.94$
\end{itemize}

Result: Effort = 280.5 person-months.
