\section{External Interface Files}
An External Interface File (EIF) is defined as a \emph{homogeneous set of data used by the application but generated and maintained by other applications}.

The only EIF of the system consists in the interface with Google Maps services, described in the DD~\cite[p.~33]{mytaxi-dd}.
We identify this EIF as \emph{Maps} in the further tables.
