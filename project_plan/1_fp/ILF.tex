\section{Internal Logic Files}
An Internal Logic File (ILF) is defined as a \emph{homogeneous set of data used
and managed by the application}.

The ILFs of our system match closely the database tables and are the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item User
	\item Passenger
	\item TaxiDriver
	\item TaxiLog
	\item Ride
\end{itemize}
