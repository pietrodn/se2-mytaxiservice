\section{Economical risks}

The economical risks are listed below. An evaluation of those risks is provided in~\autoref{tab:economical-risks}.

\begin{description}
    \item[Bankruptcy:] the income from the sales of the software may not be enough to sustain the development, manteinance and deployment of the software system. A good feasibility study helps to avoid this situation.

    \item[Regulation change:] local and State regulators can change the taxi regulation at any time, and this could have an unpredictable impact on the usage and the market penetration of our software.
    This risk can be partially avoided by a good feasibility study. This issue could be mitigated by doing lobbying on the political parties of the affected countries (where it is legal).

    \item[Competitors:] other companies can build equivalent or better products at a lower price and put myTaxiService out of the market.
