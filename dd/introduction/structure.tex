\section{Document Structure}
\label{sec:structure}

This document is structured in five parts:
\begin{description}
\item[\autoref{ch:introduction}: Introduction.] This section provides general information about the DD document and the system to be developed.
\item[\autoref{ch:architectural-design}: Architectural Design.] This section shows the main components of the systems with their sub-components and their relationships, along with their static and dynamic design. This section will also focus on design choices, styles, patterns and paradigms.
\item[\autoref{ch:algorithm-design}: Algorithm Design.] This section will present and discuss in detail the algorithms designed for the system functionalities, indipendently from their concrete implementation.
\item[\autoref{ch:ui-design}: User Interface Design.] This section shows how the user interface will look like and behave, by means of concept graphics and UX modeling.
\item[\autoref{ch:requirements-traceability}: Requirements Traceability.] This section shows how the requirements in the RASD~\cite{rasd} are satisfied by the design choices of the DD.
\end{description}
