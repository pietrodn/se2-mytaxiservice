\label{sec:scope}

The system aims to offer a simple and reliable taxi calling and reservation service for a large city.

The software system is divided into four layers, which will be presented in the document. The architecture has to be easily extensible and maintainable in order to provide new functionalities.

 Every component must be conveniently thin and must encapsulate a single functionality (high cohesion).
 The dependency between components has to be unidirectional and coupling must be avoided in order to increase the reusability of the modules.

 Design patterns and architectural styles will be used for solving architectural problems in order to simplify the system comprehension and avoid misunderstanding during the implementation phase.
