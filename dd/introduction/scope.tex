\section{Scope}
\label{sec:scope}

The system aims to offer a taxi calling and reservation service for a large city. It has to simplify the users' access and provide a reliable taxi queue management.

The system is divided into three levels, which will be presented in the document. The architecture has to be easily extendible in order to provide new functionalities and a simpler maintenance service.
 
 Every component must be conveniently thin and must incapsulate a single functionality. The dependency between them has to be unidirectional and coupling must be avoided in order to increase the reusability of the software.
 
 Design patterns will be strongly used for solving architectural problems in order to simplify the system comprehension and avoid misunderstanding during the implementation phase.
 
 The system functionalities will be caught by interfaces or abstract classes, which will be implemented in concrete classes. This will simplify eventual maintenance operations and project changes.
