\section{Components}
All the decisions in the DD have been taken following functional and nonfunctional requirements written in the RASD, although some changes are explained in \autoref{}.

The following table \autoref{tab:Comp-Table} show the {\bf section} of the requirement fulfilled by a specific {\bf component}. 
\subsection{User interfaces}

The others user non-functional requirements that are common to all clients interfaces aren't explained in this document, because they will be observed during the implementation part; although some of them, written in the following list, are shown in the UI Design \autoref{ch:ui-design}.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first screen must ask the user to login.
\item The dashboard with links to every function shall be displayed in the home page.
\item The top bar must show the last taxi service called.
\item The possibility to choose the language at all times.
\end{itemize}
