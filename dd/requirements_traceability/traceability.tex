\section{External interface requirements}
All the decisions in the DD have been taken following functional and nonfunctional requirements written in the RASD, although some changes are explained in \autoref{tab:SWreq-Table}.

In the following tables are enlightened the {\bf sections} where a specific requirement has been followed to write the DD. Every requirement appears in a generic explanation, more details would come with the implementation of the system.

\subsection{User interfaces}
The requirements are explained in \autoref{tab:UIreq-Table}
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Web application  & \ref{sec:high-level}\\
\hline
Mobile application  & details in implementation\\
\hline
Server back-end  & --\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Requirements divided in web and mobile ones}
\label{tab:UIreq-Table}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The others requirements that are common to all clients interfaces aren't explained in this document, because they will be observed during the implementation part; although some of them, written in the following list, are shown in the UI Design \autoref{ch:ui-design}.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first screen must ask the user to login.
\item The dashboard with links to every function shall be displayed in the home page.
\item The top bar must show the last taxi service called.
\item The possibility to choose the language at all times. %TODO correggi mockup!
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Hardware interfaces}
%TODO GPS on the mobile app???

\subsection{Software interfaces}

The requirements followed in this subsection are explained in \autoref{tab:SWreq-Table}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.5\textwidth}|p{0.5\textwidth}|}
\hline
Modularity: expose API to buit new interfaces and modules & \ref{sec:high-level}, \ref{sec:component-interfaces}\\
\hline
Use MySQL for DB  & \ref{sec:component-view}\\
\hline
Use Java SE8 used back-end & \textcolor{red}{this requirement has been changed in Java EE as can be seen in sections} \ref{sec:component-view}, \ref{sec:deployment-view}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Software requirements}

\subsection{Communication interfaces}
The client communicates via HTTPS as shown in the Component Intefaces \autoref{sec:component-interfaces}
