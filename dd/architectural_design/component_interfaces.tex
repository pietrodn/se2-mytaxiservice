\subsection{Application server to database}
The application server communicates to the DB via JPA and JDBC over standard network protocols. Thus, the DB and the application server layers can be deployed on different tiers, as well on the same one.

\subsection{Application server to front-ends}
The front-ends of the system (the web application and the mobile app) shall communicate with the application server using the same back-end programmatic inteface described in the RASD and implemented as a RESTful interface over the HTTPS protocol.

The RESTful interface is implemented in the application server using JAX-RS.

Also, if the web server fails for any reason, the back-end interface will be accessible by the users by means of the mobile application.

\subsection{Web server to browser}
The users' browsers communicate with the web server via HTTPS requests. Any unencrypted request will be denied, as stated in the RASD.

\subsection{Plug-in interface}
The application server exposes extension points to be used by plug-ins: they're the only points in which the plug-ins can access the system. For example, they may not query the database layer directly.

Plug-in declaration, discovery and activation are made explicit by means of manifest files and plug-in registry.
