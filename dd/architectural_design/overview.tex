\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

This chapter provides a comprehensive view over the system components, both at a physical and at a logical level.

The system will be described starting with high-level components (\autoref{sec:high-level}). This high-level design will be thoroughly dissected and detailed in \autoref{sec:component-view}.
Section~\ref{sec:deployment-view} will put some attention on the deployment of the system on physical tiers, and \autoref{sec:runtime-view} will describe the dynamic behaviour of the software.
Section~\ref{sec:component-interfaces} will focus on the interface between different components of the system.

The design choices and patterns used in the aforementioned sections will be presented and discussed in~\autoref{sec:styles-patterns}.
