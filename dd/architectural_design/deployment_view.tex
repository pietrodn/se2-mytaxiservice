The deployment diagram for the system is shown in~\autoref{fig:deployment-diagram}.
The web and the application layers can be allocated to the same physical machine (tier), but in the general case they are on different hosts.

GlassFish Server is used as the Java EE application server for both the business logic and the web tier.
