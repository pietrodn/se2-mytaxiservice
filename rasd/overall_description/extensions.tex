The system will be implemented in order to offer the possibility of further extensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide secure and reliable methods for ride payments. These functionalities will give the users the opportunity to pay for a taxi service using credit card informations stored in a secure way in their profiles.
\item Offer a taxi rating system which allows the users to evaluate the specific taxi service provided.
\item Monitor user reliability, recording when they do not show up at the meeting point or how many minutes later they arrive, in order to limit their access to the service when their reliability is bad.
\item Create a fidelity score for every user, which gives the opportunity to benefit from special offers. The score increases every time the user makes use of the taxi service, proportionally with the distance covered. 
\end{itemize}
