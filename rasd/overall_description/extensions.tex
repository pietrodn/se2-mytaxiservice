The system will be implemented in order to offer the possibility of further extensions, for example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Provide secure and reliable methods for ride payments. This functionality allow the passengers to pay for the rides using credit card information stored in a secure way in their profiles.
    \item Offer a taxi rating system which lets the passengers evaluate taxi drivers.
    \item Monitor passengers' reliability, recording when they do not show up at the meeting point or how many minutes later they arrive, in order to limit their access to the service when their reliability is bad.
    \item Create a fidelity score for every passenger, which gives them the opportunity to benefit from special offers. The score increases every time the passenger uses of the taxi service, proportionally with the distance covered.
\end{enumerate}
