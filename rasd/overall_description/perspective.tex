\subsection{User interfaces}
The clients have to deal with the dichotomy between web user interaction and mobile interfaces.
It is necessary to provide a common and uniform look and feel among the different hardware interfaces.

All the interfaces shall be intuitive and user friendly. They should not require the reading of detailed documentation to be used.

\subsection{Hardware interfaces}

The main hardware interface of the system consists in the access to the GPS data in the mobile application.

\subsection{Software interfaces}
The mobile application must support Android and iOS.
The web application works on any web server that supports Java.

The back-end stores its data in a RDBMS and  can run on every platform that supports the JVM.

The back-end must offer programmatic interfaces (APIs) for user interfaces and external modules, like:
\begin{itemize}
\item taxi reservation
\item ride sharing
\item online payments
\item web interface
\end{itemize}
