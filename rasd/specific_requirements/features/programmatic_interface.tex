\subsubsection{Purpose}

The back-end software component shall expose programmatic interfaces to ease the creation of modules that implement new function (e.g. taxi reservation, taxi sharing).

The programmatic interface will consist in Java public interfaces, classes and methods.
Modules are required to use this public interface to carry out their functions, and will be limited in what they can do by this library.

The public interface shall provide safe and controlled access to the data, throwing suitable exceptions when an illegal action is attempted by a module.

\subsubsection{Associated functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Creation of a new user (taxi driver or passenger)
\item Modification of user profile
\item Reservation of a taxi for a specific path in a specific time
\item Updating the location of an user
\item Taxi availability and status handling
