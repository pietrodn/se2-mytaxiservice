\label{user-login}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
Any subscribed user can login to use myTaxiService services.
The system recalls the nickname or the registration e-mail and the password to log in correctly.

If the user doesn't recall his password, a new one is sent on the user's mail address. Only if the user clicks on the link in the e-mail the password is reset and, soon as he logs in, it is asked him to choose a new one. 

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Bob opens the home of myTaxiService page on web and clicks on "login". 
It is asked him to enter nickname or e-mail and password, he doesn't recall his nickname so he enters the registration e-mail and the password. He selects "enter". 
Everything is correct so he can access to app services as a logged user.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Alice opens the home of myTaxiService page on web and clicks on "login".  
It is asked her to enter nickname or e-mail and password, she enters nickname and password and selects "enter". However the password entered isn't the correct one so the system asks her to reenter it. 
After some failed attempts she select "password forgot". 
The system sends a new password via e-mail. She enters that one and the access is permitted, but before ending the login successfully the system requires her to change the password entering a new one. 
After she has done it correctly she has finally obtained access to application services.
