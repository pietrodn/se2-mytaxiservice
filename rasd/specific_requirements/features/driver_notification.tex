\label{driver-notification}
\subsubsection{Purpose}

After a taxi driver has informed the system about his/her availability, %TODO 3.2.5 reference
he/she will be able to receive ride request notifications. The taxi driver receives the notification on his/her cell phone and has one minute to accept or reject the request. If after one minute the request is not answered, the system will consider the request as refused.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Travis, who suffers from chronic insomnia, every night waits in his taxi for an incoming request. When a user requests a taxi, the system processes the request and decides which taxi driver to send. 

For a new incoming request, the system chooses Travis, who is on the top of the queue and quite near the location. It sends him a notification on his mobile app. Travis reads the message which reports location and hour of the meeting and decides to accept the request pushing the appropriate button on the display.

The system acknowledges the decision and waits for Travis to notify that the passenger is on board (last part of \ref{standard-call}).

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
The system receives a new incoming request from a user and selects Frank Martin as designated taxi driver. %TODO 3.2.5 reference
The system sends him a notification and waits for the reply.

Frank has done a very demanding ride and decides to refuse the request using the interface of the app. The system receives Frank's decision and looks for another available taxi on the defined area.
