\label{user-registration}
\subsubsection{Purpose}
Any user car subscribe through the web application or the mobile one. 

In both cases user has to fill a registration form and must agree the personal data treatment according his/her country privacy policy, otherwise the registration request is denied.

The system registers the user: 
As soon as he/she has submitted the privacy policy agreement, the system verifies the consistence of the informations submitted and a confirmation mail is sent to verify the availability of the user mail-address. 
After this last check the registration ends successfully.

The system has two kind of registration forms (so two kind of registered users) one for passenger and one for taxi drivers.


\begin{itemize}
\item Passenger registration form: 
The system registers the user as a passenger; once the user has subscribed the system allows him or her to rent a taxi. 
The form requires the following informations:
\begin{itemize}
\item mail-address
\item username 
\item password
\item Name
\item Surname
\item address (optional filling)
\item phone number (optional filling)
\end{itemize}




\item Taxi driver registration form: 
The taxi driver registration is more restrictive and requires more user's informations.
The system registers a user that claims to be a taxi driver only if he is able to demonstrate it with a taxi license; also a medical certificate that ensures the good health of the driver is required.
The form requires the following informations:

\begin{itemize}
\item mail-address
\item username 
\item password
\item Name
\item Surname
\item address 
\item phone number
\item medical certificate
%name of the doctor?
\item taxi license
\item taxi id-number
\item taxi number-plate
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Alice, a normal citizen without a car, has just discovered the existence of myTaxiService web application and she wants to use it. 
She opens the home of myTaxiService page on web and clicks on "passenger registration". 

She gives all the informations required and she authorizes the personal data treatment. 

The system verifies the informations submitted and sends a confirmation mail.
So Alice checks the mailbox, opens the mail and clicks on the button "confirm e-mail". 

The system informs Alice that the registration has ended with success.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Bob is a taxi driver that wants to subscribe to myTaxiService application. 
He downloads the mobile application from his phone app-store and once he opens it, he selects "taxi driver registration". 
He fills the form, luckily he has gone to the doctor some days before and has a certificate, and authorizes the personal data treatment.
However he forgot to write his phone number on the form so the system warns him about the forgetfulness.
Only after the complete and correct filling of the form, and the personal data treatment authorization, the registration is one step near the successfully end.

The system verifies, one more time, the informations submitted and sends a confirmation mail.
So Bob checks the mailbox, opens the mail and clicks on the button "confirm e-mail". 

The system informs Bob that the registration has ended with success.
