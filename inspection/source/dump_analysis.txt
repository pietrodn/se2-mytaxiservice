CODE INSPECTION CHECK LIST
Points marked as DONE are completely analyzed.

Naming convention

1. What does the function do??
2. DONE not found
3. DONE not found
4. DONE not found
5. DONE (not so wrong Java library)  line 1979, 1992, 2007, 2022, 2037
                            used .elements() instead for instance .getElements()
                            in Enumeration structure

                            line 1981, 1994, 2009, 2024, 2039
                            used .nextElements() instead for instance .getNextElements()
                            in Enumeration structure

                            THIS ARE NOT PROPERLY ERRORS

6. DONE all attributes do not begin with "_" but have lowercase first letter
        and all the next words have capitalized first letters
7. DONE not found in function, but in class line 110 constant does not respect the convention


Indentation

8. DONE space are all corrects
9. DONE no tabs found


Braces

10. DONE all in "Allman" style
11. DONE all control statements respect this


File Organization

12. DONE blank lines usage is optimal
13. DONE without considering indentation, the longest line length is 78 characters
        otherwise it is 94 characters. Line 1981 and 1968.
14. DONE respected


Wrapping Lines

15. DONE no line break
16. DONE
17. DONE every line ok


Comments

18. DONE comments clear
19. DONE code commented: line 1968, date non present nor explained


Java source file

20. DONE not public class in this file
21. DONE not public class in this file
22. DONE not public interface, the description of the function is general, but it does nothing...
23. DONE java doc incomplete because the specification in generic and the function does nothing

Package and Import Statements

24. DONE the package is the first non commented line and the imports follow it


Class and Interface Declaration

25. DONE
      A. DONE correct order
      B. DONE correct order
      C. DONE not present
      D. DONE static and non static attributes are mixed
      E. DONE private instance variables before the package level one line 143,144

26. DONE the methods are grouped generally by functionality
27. DONE massive duplications (not specific in this function)

Initialization and declaration

28. DONE all private methods are correct but line 139 _logger has to be private
    line 143 localTID has to be private
29. DONE in function all ok
30. DONE in function all ok
31. DONE in function
32. DONE in function
33. DONE in function all ok

Method calls

34. DONE in function all ok
35. DONE in function all ok
36. DONE possible errors in in casts but all package checked

Arrays

37. DONE no classical arrays, all objects accessed using hasMoreElements and nextElements
38. DONE
39. DONE

Object Compariosons

40. DONE no object comparisons

Output Format

41. DONE no displayed output
42. DONE no error messages
43. DONE no output

Computation, Comparisons and Assignments

44. DONE no brutish programming, all checked
45. DONE no complex expression, the function does nothing
    (only correct precedence in function is . respect (cast) )
46. DONE no precedence problems
47. DONE no divisions
48. DONE no divisions, no operations, no truncations
49. DONE all null checked are done, all comparisons are correct
50. DONE no throw exception
51. DONE all the casts are explicit

Exceptions

52. DONE no exceptions required
53. DONE no exceptions required

Flow control

54. DONE no switch
55. DONE no switch
56. DONE all while cycles are done correctly on elements in Enumeration

Files

57. DONE no files in function
58. DONE no files in function
59. DONE no files in function
60. DONE no files in function
