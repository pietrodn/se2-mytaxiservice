CODE INSPECTION CHECK LIST
Points marked as DONE are completely analyzed.

Naming convention

1. What does the function do??
2. DONE not found
3. DONE not found
4. DONE not found
5. DONE (not so wrong)      line 1979, 1992, 2007, 2022, 2037
                            used .elements() instead for instance .getElements()
                            in Enumeration structure

                            line 1981, 1994, 2009, 2024, 2039
                            used .nextElements() instead for instance .getNextElements()
                            in Enumeration structure

                            THIS ARE NOT PROPERLY ERRORS

6. DONE all attributes do not begin with "_" but have lowercase first letter
        and all the next words have capitalized first letters
7. DONE not found in function, but in class line 110 constant does not respect the convention


Indentation

8. DONE space are all corrects
9. DONE no tabs found


Braces

10. DONE all in "Allman" style
11. DONE all control statements respect this


File Organization

12. DONE blank lines usage is optimal

        otherwise it is 94 characters. Line 1981.
14. DONE respected

      D. DONE static and non static attributes are mixed
      E. DONE private instance variables before the package level one line 143,144

26. DONE the methods are grouped generally by functionality
27. DONE massive duplications (in our functions)
