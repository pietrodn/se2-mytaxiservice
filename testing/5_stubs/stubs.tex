\chapter{Program Stubs and Test Data Required}
\label{chap:stubs}

In order to perform integration testing without having developed first the entire system (``big bang'' approach) we need to use stubs and drivers to take the part of the software components that still don't exist and test the others.

\begin{description}
    \item[Test database:] the testing environment must include a DBMS configured in the same way of the production. The test data contained in this database includes a reduced set of instances of all the entities described in the Entity-Relation diagram of the Design Document~\cite[p.~10]{mytaxi-dd}, which is reported in~\autoref{fig:er-diagram}

    \item[Lightweight API client:] in order to sest the REST API of the business tier without the actual client application, a simple API client which interacts with the business tier by simple HTTP requests is needed. This driver needs to be scriptable in order for the tests to be automated.
