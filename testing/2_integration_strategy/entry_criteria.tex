\section{Entry Criteria}
\label{sec:entry-criteria}

All the classes and functions must pass severe unity tests which should reasonably discover main issues in the classes structure or in the algorithms coding. 
Furthermore all the software has to be accurately inspected in order to preserve the maintainability and find possible issues which can increase the testers' effort in next testing phases. 
Finally the documentation of all classes and functions has to be complete and up-to-date in order to be used as reference for integration testing development.
