\section{Integration Testing Strategy}
\label{sec:integration-testing-strategy}

The integration strategy of choice is the \textbf{bottom-up approach}.
This choice comes natural since we assume to already have the unit tests for the smallest components, so we can proceed from the bottom.

Moreover, the higher-level subsystems outlined in~\autoref{sec:elements} are well separated and loosely coupled since they correspond to different tiers;
they also communicate through well-defined interfaces (REST API, HTTP), so they won't be hard to integrate at a later time.
In this way it will be possible also to limit the stubs needed in order to accomplish the integration, because the specific components do not use the general ones,  so they do not require stubs.
